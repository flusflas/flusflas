ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm Dani. I'm a backend developer, and when Iâ€™m not out having a life, Iâ€™m probably fighting Python and Go.

I love starting tons of projects I'll never finish, trying to learn more things than Iâ€™ll ever have time for, and building stuff no one will ever use. You can find some of those here.
